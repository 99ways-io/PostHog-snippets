/*
  Simple CSS snippet to hide an HTML element by its ID.
  Replace '#element-to-hide' with the actual ID of the element you want to hide.
  The `!important` flag is used to increase specificity and help ensure the style is applied,
  but use it judiciously as it can make debugging CSS more complex.

  display: none !important;
