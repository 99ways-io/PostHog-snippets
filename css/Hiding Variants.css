/*
  This CSS rule is used to hide a specific element with the ID 'variant-element-to-hide'.
  This is often used in A/B testing scenarios where:
  - This element might be part of an original page version that needs to be hidden when a variant is active.
  - Or, this element itself is a variant that should be hidden by default and only shown when its
    corresponding test group is activated by the A/B testing script.
  The `!important` flag is used to ensure this style overrides other display properties
  that might be applied to the element, making sure it remains hidden as intended.

#variant-element-to-hide {
  display: none !important;
